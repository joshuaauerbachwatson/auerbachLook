// Class to manage a simple logging facility (to disk).  The emphasis is on simple low-volume logging with the fewest possible frills.

// The 'log' method exists in two forms:
//      1.  To open the log on a specific path use openLog(String)->FileHandle?
//          To log to the resulting handle use log(FileHandle, String).
//      2.  The alternate log(String) caches the filehandle in a static variable and assume a specific naming scheme (and capacity limit).
//             There is no public 'open' method in this case.

// Implicit logging with the standard naming is recommended for apps.  The alternative can be used by app extensions to store the log in a shared container.

// Also includes some useful global functions packaged here rather than in "Useful" because they are used here or in app extensions (and Useful has stuff
// that's hard to incorporate into app extensions).
